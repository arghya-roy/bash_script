### POSITIONAL PARAMETERS
The shell assigns numbers called positional parameters to
each command-line argument that is entered. ($1, $2, $3…).
```
vi demo1.sh
```
```
#!/bin/bash
echo “My Name is $1”
echo “My Friend name is $2”
echo “My School name is $3”
```
```
./demo1.sh Arghya Suvo Roy
```
```
OUTPUT-
echo “My Name is Arghya
echo “My Friend name is Suvo 
echo “My School name is Roy
```
### SPECIAL PARAMETERS
Special parameters are like regular parameters, but are
created for us by the shell, and are unmodifiable.

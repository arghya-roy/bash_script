### WHILE LOOPS:
while loops run a set of commands while a certain
condition is true, hence their name.

while loops will continue to run until either:

1. the condition command that theyâ€™re provided with
becomes false (i.e. returns a non-zero exit code)
2. The loop is interrupted.

#### Syntax for the while loop:
```
while condition; do
commands...
done
```
```
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter your number: " num
while [ "$num" -gt 10 ]; do
echo "$num"
num=$(( "$num" - 1 ))
done
```
## 1) while [[ command ]]; - String releated
mainly we use double bracket where anything releated to string.
#### There are some example which you can pass inside single third bracket.
`string1 == string2` True if the strings are equal. It will perform pattern matching when used with the [[ command. The = notation should be used with the test command for POSIX   conformance. </br>
`string1 = string2` (same as string1 == string2 ). </br>
`string1 != string2` True if the strings are not equal. </br>
`string1 =~ regex` True if the strings match the Bash regular expression regex. Captured groups are stored in the BASH_REMATCH array variable. </br>
`string1 < string2` True if string1 sorts before string2 lexicographically. </br>
`string1 > string2` True if string1 sorts after string2 lexicographically. </br>
`=` `[[ $a = $b ]]` Successful if the two strings are equal </br>
`!=` `[[ $a != $b ]]` Successful if the two strings are not equal </br>
`-z` `[[ -z $c ]]` Successful if a string is empty </br>
`-n` `[[ -n $c ]]` Successful if a string is not empty </br>

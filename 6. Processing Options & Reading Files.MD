### WHILE LOOPS:
while loops run a set of commands while a certain
condition is true, hence their name.

while loops will continue to run until either:

1. the condition command that theyâ€™re provided with
becomes false (i.e. returns a non-zero exit code)
2. The loop is interrupted.

#### Syntax for the while loop:
```
while condition; do
commands...
done
```
```
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter your number: " num
while [ "$num" -gt 10 ]; do
echo "$num"
num=$(( "$num" - 1 ))
done
```

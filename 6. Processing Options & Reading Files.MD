### WHILE LOOPS:
while loops run a set of commands while a certain
condition is true, hence their name.

while loops will continue to run until either:

1. the condition command that they’re provided with
becomes false (i.e. returns a non-zero exit code)
2. The loop is interrupted.

#### Syntax for the while loop:
```
while condition; do
commands...
done
```
```
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter your number: " num
while [ "$num" -gt 10 ]; do
echo "$num"
num=$(( "$num" - 1 ))
done
```
## 1) while [[ command ]]; - String releated
mainly we use double bracket where anything releated to string.
#### There are some example which you can pass inside single third bracket.
`string1 == string2` True if the strings are equal. It will perform pattern matching when used with the [[ command. The = notation should be used with the test command for POSIX   conformance. </br>
`string1 = string2` (same as string1 == string2 ). </br>
`string1 != string2` True if the strings are not equal. </br>
`string1 =~ regex` True if the strings match the Bash regular expression regex. Captured groups are stored in the BASH_REMATCH array variable. </br>
`string1 < string2` True if string1 sorts before string2 lexicographically. </br>
`string1 > string2` True if string1 sorts after string2 lexicographically. </br>
`=` `[[ $a = $b ]]` Successful if the two strings are equal </br>
`!=` `[[ $a != $b ]]` Successful if the two strings are not equal </br>
`-z` `[[ -z $c ]]` Successful if a string is empty </br>
`-n` `[[ -n $c ]]` Successful if a string is not empty </br>


## 2) while [ command ]; - compare numbers and testing
Comparing numbers and testing whether a file exists or other testing. 
</br>
#### There are some example which you can pass inside single bracket.

`-eq` `[ 2 -eq 2 ]` Successful if the two numbers are equal </br>
`-ne` `[ 2 -ne 2 ]` Successful if the two numbers are not equal </br>
`-e` `[ -e /path/to/file ]` Successful if a file system entry /path/to/file exists </br>
`-f` `[ -f /path/to/file ]` Successful if a file system entry /path/to/file exists and is a regular file </br>
`-d`  `[ -d /path/to/dir ]` Successful if a file system entry /path/to/file exists and is a directory </br>
`-x` `[ -x /path/to/file ]` Successful if a file system entry /path/to/dir exists and is executable by the current user </br>
`-a file` True if file exists. </br>
`-b file` True if file exists and is a block special file . </br>
`-c file` True if file exists and is a character special file . </br>
`-d file` True if file exists and is a directory. </br>
`-e file` True if file exists. </br>

`-g file` True if file exists and its set-group-id bit is set. </br>
`-h file` True if file exists and is a symbolic link. </br>
`-k file` True if file exists and its “sticky” bit is set. </br>
`-p file` True if file exists and is a named pipe (FIFO). </br>
`-r file` True if file exists and is readable. </br>
`-s file` True if file exists and has a size greater than zero. </br>
`-t fd` True if file descriptor fd is open and refers to a terminal. </br>
`-u file` True if file exists and its set-user-id bit is set. </br>
`-w file` True if file exists and is writable. </br>
`-x file` True if file exists and is executable. </br>
`-G file` True if file exists and is owned by the effective group id. </br>
`-L file` True if file exists and is a symbolic link. </br>
`-N file` True if file exists and has been modified since it was last read. </br>
`-O file` True if file exists and is owned by the effective user id. </br>
`-S file` True if file exists and is a socket. </br>
`file1 -ef file2` True if file1 and file2 refer to the same device and inode numbers. </br>
`file1 -nt file2` True if file1 is newer (according to modification date) than file2 , or if file1 exists and file2 does not. </br>
`file1 -ot file2` True if file1 is older than file2 , or if file2 exists and file1 does not. </br>
`-o optname` True if the shell option optname is enabled (see set -o for a list of options). </br>

`-n string` True if the length of string is non-zero. </br>
`arg1 -eq arg2` True if arg1 equal to arg2 </br>
`arg1 -ne arg2` True if arg1 not equal to arg2 </br>
`arg1 -lt arg2` True if arg1 less than arg2 </br>
`arg1 -le arg2` True if arg1 less than or equal to arg2 </br>
`arg1 -gt arg2` True if arg1 greater than arg2 </br>
`arg1 -ge arg2` True if arg1 greater than or equal to arg2 </br>

## 3) if (( command )); - Arithmetic evaluation and C-style variable manipulation
The double parentheses construct in bash allows: </br>
**Arithmetic evaluation.** Defining a variable as a=$(( 1+1 )) calculates the equation and sets a to 2. </br>
**C-style variable manipulation.** For example, incrementing variables with (( a++ )). </br>

## 1) if ( command ); - Not use too much-
Using single parentheses in bash scripting creates a subshell. When combined with the if statement, the subprocess finishes before continuing the program. The if analyzes the exit status and acts accordingly. </br>
In this commands running inside if does not keep its result, it works as a local command or local variable. we will understand in after reading the below example.
```
#!/bin/bash
outer_variable=Defined
echo Before while:
echo inner_variable = $inner_variable
echo outer_variable = $outer_variable
while (
        echo Inside subshell:
        inner_variable=Defined
        echo inner_variable = $inner_variable
        outer_variable=Changed
        echo outer_variable = $outer_variable
);
do
        echo After then:
        echo inner_variable = $iner_variable
        echo outer_variable = $outer_variable
        break

done
echo After while:
echo inner_variable = $inner_variable
echo outer_variable = $outer_variable
```
#### Output will be -
```
Before while:
inner_variable =
outer_variable = Defined
Inside subshell:
inner_variable = Defined
outer_variable = Changed
After then:
inner_variable =
outer_variable = Defined
After while:
inner_variable =
outer_variable = Defined
```

### HANDLING COMMAND LINE OPTIONS:
The getopts command enables bash to get the the
options provided to the script on the command line.
#### Explanation -
as a example when we run `ls` then it gives ony containing files or folders but excluding hidden dir or folfer. when we use `ls -l` then it gives long list, here `-l` is a option.
when we run `ls -a` then it gives including hidden details, here `-a` is a option.
### getopts is just a linux command.
- However, getopts does not get all the options at once; it
  only gets the very next option on the command line each
  time it is run. <br/>
- Therefore, the getopts command is often used as part of a
while loop, to ensure that all command line options are
processed.
### Syntax for the getopts command
getopts "optstring" variable
```
getopts "Ab" variable_name # option is -A and -b and cannot pass any argument like name.sh -b 10
getopts "A:b" variable_name # option is -A and -b and cannot pass any argument like name.sh -b 10
```
- You can call variable whatever you like. However, it isconventionally called “opt” because it stores the most
 recent option that getopts has found.
- Any single letter we place in the optstring is considered as its own option.
- getopts can only process one-letter options (long-form options such as --all are not supported.)
- options are case-sensitive.
- The getopts command is often used in conjunction with
a while loop so that we ensure that each option on the
command line gets processed.
- In order to allow the script to perform different actions
based on the options that are provided, we often also put
a case statement inside the while loop, with one case for
each option.
- When an unexpected option is provided to the getopts
command, it stores a literal question mark inside the
variable.
- Therefore, it is good practice to create a \? case to
respond to any invalid options. The backslash (\) ensures
that the ? is interpreted literally, and not as a special
globbing pattern character.


### Example
```
vi demo.sh
```
```
while getopts "Ab" variable_name; do
case "$variable_name" in
A)
echo "you are using option A"
;;
b)
echo "you are using option b"
;;
\?)
echo "you are not using any specified option"
;;
esac
done
```
The below command executes the commans in option A
```
./demo.sh -A
```
The below command executes the commans in option b
```
./demo.sh -b
```

### Option Arguments - 
- Sometimes, options can accept arguments of their own. For example, let’s say we had the command - `ourscript -A 10`
- In order to allow the -A option to accept an argument, such as “10”, we would need to place a colon (:) after the letter “A” in the optstring, like so: `getopts "A:b"  variable`
- Whatever argument that is provided with an option is stored in the **$OPTARG** shell variable.
- So, if we ran the command ourscript -A 10, the $OPTARG variable would store the value of 10 when the getopts command processed the -A option
 #### Example -
 ```
 #!/bin/bash
while getopts "c:f:" opt; do
case "$opt" in
c) # convert from celsius to farenheit
result=$(echo "scale=2; ($OPTARG * (9 / 5)) + 32" | bc)
;;
f) # convert from fahrenheit to celsius
result=$(echo "scale=2; ($OPTARG - 32) * (5/9)" | bc)
;;
\?)
Echo "Invalid option provided"
;;
esac
echo "$result"
done
```

## READ-WHILE LOOPS:
- Read-while loops are simply while loops that use the read
command as their test command.
- They are used to read lines of output one by one, and do
something for each line.
- A read-while loop can be used to iterate over the contents
of files, or over the output of a command (or pipeline).
### Example Script: Iterating over a file line by line, and printing each line out
```
#!/bin/bash
while read line; do
echo "$line"
done < file1.txt
```
### ITERATING OVER THE OUTPUT FROM COMMANDS -
This is achieved using a technique known as process
substitution. Process substitution simply allows us to
treat the output of a command (or commands) as a file.
#### Syntax for process substitution
```
<(command) # You can run one command...
<(command1 | command2 | ... | commandN) #... Or an entire pipeline
```
We can then simple read the output of the command into
the while loop as if it was a file:
```
while read line; do
commands...
done < <(command)
```
```
#!/bin/bash
while read line; do
echo "$line"
done < <(ls $HOME)
```
